# Casio fx CG 10/20/50 add-ins
### About
This is a collection of Add-Ins for the CASIO fx-CG 10/20/50 Calculator. 

### Using these add-ins
All of these projects have a .g3a file in them which is the latest version that I compiled. Download them, then connect your calculator to a computer with a miniUSB cable, and save them to the *root* directory (That means, do not place them into any folder). Note that I am activly developing some of them, therefore they might not work as expected. If one of the add-ins freezes your calculator, use the reset button at the back and tell me about the issue!

### Getting started coding add-ins yourself
